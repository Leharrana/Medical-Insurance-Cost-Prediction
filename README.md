# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This project predicts individual medical insurance costs based on demographic and lifestyle features using regression models. It demonstrates the application of machine learning to analyze health-related expenses.

1. Features of the Dataset
Age: Age of the individual.
Gender: Male/Female.
BMI: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
Children: Number of dependents covered under the insurance.
Smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker or not.
Region: Residential region.
Charges: Final medical insurance cost (target variable).
Workflow

2.Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualized the relationships between features and target costs.
Identified data trends and potential outliers.

3. Data Preprocessing:
Categorical encoding for non-numeric variables.
Outlier detection and handling.
Train-test split for model evaluation.

4. Predictive Modeling:
Linear Regression for baseline predictions.
Gradient Boosting and Random Forest for enhanced accuracy.
Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
